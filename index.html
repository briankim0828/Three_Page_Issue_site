      <h2>In the 21st century, everybody is connected to the internet. It
      doesn't matter if you are a male, female, old, young, rich or poor: our lives have
      become inseparable with the web. The vast amounts of information we consume on a
      daily basis is unprecedented, as we never had such easy access before in our history.
      While this could have been the best method for our species to overcome each other's
      differences and understand one another better, we are unfortunately under the unfluence of
      filter bubbles: our own digital rabbithole of information created by recommendation algorithms.
      Such algorithms make use of our digital data to track our behaviors, preferences, and opinions
      to hand-select information that it deems we would enjoy most. Because of this, we are increasingly
      limiting ourselves to smaller pools of information, such as similar preferences, similar political
      opinions, and much more. We are becoming more isolated than ever before.</h2>
